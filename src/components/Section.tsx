        Hi, I’m Niall. I’m a research associate based in the <span className="wrapper_link"><a className="link" href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/eee">School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering</a></span> at NTU Singapore. My work primarily concerns the scattering of polarised light in random media.
        </p>
        <p className="section_text">
        I completed my PhD in 2023 at <span className="wrapper_link"><a className="link" href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/photonics/">Imperial College London</a></span>. In my thesis, I developed computational methods for generating random scattering matrices whose statistical properties resemble those of realistic scattering media.
        </p>
        <p className="section_text">
        I’ve previously worked as a mathematics teacher in Shanghai and occasionally do private tutoring. Outside of work, I’m also an avid language learner and constantly strive to improve my Mandarin skills.
